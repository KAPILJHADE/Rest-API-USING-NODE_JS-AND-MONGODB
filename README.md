# Rest-API-USING-NODE_JS-AND-MONGODB

This is a basic API using Node-js and MongoDB, its a car rental system having the following features – 
• Add new cars 
• Book a specific car based on its availability. A car can have multiple bookings
• Show the cars that are available to book on a date, time, seating capacity or other filters
• Using Car Model (only) show the details of a particular car and its currently active booking
Update/Delete a Car from the system and ensure that the car is not already booked. 

I have used MVC architectural concepts of Node-js.

This is only the backend part, it can be tested using POSTMAN. POSTMAN collections and the steps to test the API are provided in the file POSTMAN_collections.txt.
